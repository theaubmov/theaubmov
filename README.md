# 👋 Hi, I’m Ayoub Ait Lachgar

I build **workflow automation systems**, **BPMN modeling platforms**, and **scalable web applications** — with a strong focus on **executable BPMN**, **process governance**, and **developer-grade tooling**.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- **Deterministic orchestration** (BPMN/DMN, workflow engines, governance)
- **Modern product engineering** (React/TypeScript, design systems, testing)
- **Automation & AI** (routing, pipelines, integrating AI where it adds value — without breaking reliability)

🌍 Based in **Morocco** · 💻 Remote-friendly · 🤝 Open to impactful consulting / contracts

---

## 🚀 What I do best

### 🧩 Workflow & BPMN Platforms
- Executable **BPMN 2.0** design, governance-ready templates
- Orchestration layers around workflow engines (APIs, microservices, observability)
- Workflow engine work: **Camunda 7/8**, **Flowable**, **SpiffWorkflow**
- BPMN editor customization with **bpmn.io** (properties panel, custom elements, behaviors, palettes)

### 🧱 Product Engineering (Frontend-heavy, backend-capable)
- Complex UI modules for enterprise products (builders, dashboards, compliance tooling)
- Strong testing culture: unit + integration + E2E (Jest/Cypress)
- Backend when needed: Spring Boot / NestJS / Node.js, integrations, auth, messaging

### 🤖 Automation & AI (pragmatic)
- n8n / Make automations, intelligent routing, data pipelines
- AI where it makes sense: assisted modeling, classification, extraction, summarization
- Focus: **governed + observable** automation (not “magic prompts”)

---

## 🧪 What I’m exploring now
- Cloud-native workflow engines and orchestration patterns
- Local-first editors + real-time collaboration
- AI-assisted **process modeling** and **governance** (assist users without breaking BPM discipline)

---

## 🏗 Selected Experience Highlights
- **Apromore (Remote)** — built advanced front-end modules (property management, compliance, dashboard/builder features) and enhanced BPMN editor usability.  
- **SpiffWorkflow (Remote)** — worked on BPMN editor UX, executable workflow interpretation, and editor-to-runtime integration.  
- **Gain Solutions (Remote)** — led development of BPMN-based business tools and portals; shipped workflow products end-to-end.  
- **Attijariwafa Bank (Casablanca)** — implemented business processes with Camunda + Spring Boot; built orchestration services integrating MQ + Keycloak; strengthened reliability with testing.

## 📌 How I can help
If you're building or modernizing a workflow product, I can help you:
- Design **executable BPMN** that won’t collapse in production
- Build a **workflow orchestration layer** around microservices + APIs
- Customize **BPMN editors** into real product-grade modeling tools
- Plan/execute **Camunda 7 → 8** migration with minimal disruption

---

## 🤝 Open Source
I’m interested in contributing to projects around:
- BPMN modeling/editors (bpmn.io ecosystem)
- Workflow engines & orchestration tooling
- Developer tools for process automation

If you maintain a workflow/BPMN project and want help improving editor UX, modeling capabilities, or integration patterns — I’m happy to collaborate.
