# Ayoub Ait Lachgar

I build workflow automation systems and BPMN platforms that actually work in production.

## What I do

**Workflow orchestration**: Executable BPMN/DMN engines (Camunda, Flowable, SpiffWorkflow), custom modeling tools with bpmn.io, governance-ready templates

**Product engineering**: React/TypeScript frontends, design systems, backend services (Spring Boot/NestJS), proper testing (Jest/Cypress/E2E)

**Automation**: n8n pipelines, intelligent routing, AI where it doesn't break reliability

## Currently exploring
- Cloud-native orchestration patterns
- Local-first BPMN editors with real-time collab
- AI-assisted modeling that respects BPM discipline

## Stack
TypeScript · Java · React · NodeJs · Spring Boot · Camunda · Docker · AWS

## Open to
Contributing to BPMN tooling, workflow engines, or orchestration projects. If you need help with editor UX or integration patterns, let's talk.
